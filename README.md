# Master project, DCAM MIPT
My master project at DCAM, MIPT

The main goal of the project is to create a model of assimilation processes using some heuristical assumptions:

* The geometry of the culture space is sphere
* There is a vector space (B,R^n, +, *)
* Pair/cluster interactions(depends on the model)
